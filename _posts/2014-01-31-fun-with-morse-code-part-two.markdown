title: Fun with Morse Code - Part two
---

After reading a number of [Ember JS](http://emberjs.com) tutorials, I
wanted to build something simple to better understand it and to see how
it integrates with Ruby on Rails.

I decided to write a Rails application which uses the
[Morsu](https://github.com/zaid/morsu) gem that I wrote last year (to
convert plaintext <-> Morse code).

The application uses the latest released version of Ember (1.3.1.1) and
the latest version of Ember Data (1.0.0.beta4).

If anyone is interested, the application is called
[Emorsu](https://github.com/zaid/emorsu) and it is hostd on Github.
