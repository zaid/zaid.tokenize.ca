title: Fun with Morse code
---

The idea to this came 2 days ago and I thought it would be a good
exercise in building a gem and using Thor to create a commandline
interface to it.

Its still in its infancy and it only supports converting plaintext to
Morse code but it shouldn't take long to finish the rest of it.

If anyone is interested, the gem is called [Morsu](https://github.com/zaid/morsu) and it is hosted on Github.
